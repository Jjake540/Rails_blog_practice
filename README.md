I'm following this walkthough to get an understanding on Rails.

(https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#showing-a-list-of-articles)[Getting Started with Rails]


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
